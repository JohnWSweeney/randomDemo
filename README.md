# randomDemo

A Windows console app demonstrating C++ random number capabilities.

### Motivation
"Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin." --  John von Neumann

Like my [threadDemo](https://github.com/JohnWSweeney/threadDemo) repo, crash course.

### Basic

>*basic seedInt integer*
### CoinFlip

>*coinFlip*

where *rand* is seeded with the system time.

### CoinFlipStreak
How many times would you need to flip a coin to get a streak of heads or tails?

>*coinFlipStreak integer*

x
### App Control
